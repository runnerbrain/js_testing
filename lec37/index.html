When a function is invoked a new Execution context is created and put into the execution stack.

Each EC has a variable environment.
<br/>
It has an outer envirnoment.
<br/>
It also gives us a variable callee "this"
<br />
Note: what about methods. Note: When inside an object, the value of a primitive type is called a property and if it's a function it's called a method.
<br />

Conclusion:
so in closing the this keyword is the global variable when invoked from inside a function
but when used from inside the method of an object, the this keyword points to the object itself.
however any internal functions inside the method present us with what most people believe to be a bug in the JS programming language
so the workaround is to create an object called self and set it equal to this which is pointing to the object and then use self instead of this.
